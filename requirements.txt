From Chemical Engineering to Industrial Machine Learning 🚀

During my master’s thesis, I worked on data-driven modeling in process systems.  
That experience sparked my interest in combining physical understanding with predictive analytics.

Today, I’m expanding that foundation into applied industrial machine learning.

To explore this intersection, I built an end-to-end ML project using the UCI Machine Learning Repository – Gas Turbine CO & NOx Emission dataset.

🎯 Objective:
Predict NOx emissions and identify operating conditions that minimize emissions without sacrificing energy output.

🔎 Project highlights:
• Cleaned and validated 36,000+ industrial sensor records  
• Applied log-transformation to correct skewed emission data  
• Built a baseline Linear Regression model (R² ≈ 0.53)  
• Developed a Random Forest model (R² ≈ 0.87)  
• Applied SHAP for model interpretability  
• Performed multi-objective optimization (emissions vs energy trade-off)

📊 Key insight:
NOx formation is strongly non-linear.  
Ambient Temperature and Turbine Inlet Temperature emerged as dominant drivers — fully aligned with combustion thermodynamics.

Optimization identified operating windows reducing NOx to ~42 mg/m³ while maintaining energy output above plant average.

This project reflects my transition toward leveraging machine learning in industrial energy systems — turning engineering knowledge into intelligent decision-support tools.

I welcome feedback and discussion, especially from professionals working in industrial AI, energy systems, or process optimization.
